Key idea: A shell is simply the outermost layer of an operating system. It's designed to provide a way for you to interact with the tools and services that your operating system provides.

#GUI  (Graphical User Interface
    -instructions to the computer bi interacting whit things like windows, menus, icons, and buttons.
#CLI - Command-Line Interface
    -User interface where you give instructions to the computer by enteiring lines of text.

BASH - Notes:

echo $COLUMNS x $LINES

returns how big my terminal is.

mv *2014*.jpg vacation
curl -o google.html -L 'http://google.com'

curl 'googel.com'
(without the -L)
That's because this URL redirects elsewhere. Since we didn't include the -L option, curl did not follow the redirect (and simply downloaded the redirection data the server sent back


curl 'google.com'
In this case, the address is not redirecting somewhere elseâ€”so it downloads the code for the Web page stored at https://www.google.com and displays it in the terminal.
